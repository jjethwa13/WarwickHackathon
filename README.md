# WarwickHackathon
Project Plutus 2.0
This project uses mathematical finance techniques to provide a set of functions that can be used in python to solve problems such as finding optimum portfolios and efficiency frontiers.
Some functions that are currently implemented include:
> 1. tangencyPortfolio()
> 2. plotEfficientFrontier()
> 3. minVariancePortfolio()

## Prerequisites
This project uses numpy and matplotlib in addition to standard Python libaries
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
## Instructions
Run on a Python IDE, calling functions from a Market object which is initiated with a list of return distributions (assets). A test file is included with two example assets and some example functions on the market

## Built with
